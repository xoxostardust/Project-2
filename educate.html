            <h2>Analysis.</h2>
            <p>Google was the first of its competitors to begin using this sly method of taking data. For example, data scientists began to realize that their programs could analyze and recognize different components of text in a search bar. The question you typed is now currently being analyzed by Google servers for typos, grammar, punctuation, and more.</p>

            <h2>Prediction.</h2>
            <p>After analysis comes prediction. The way you use grammar may indicate to the system that you have formal or informal education. Additionally, it can also predict if you are extroverted, what you may be shopping for, or whether or not you are in a hurry (think typos occurring as if you are busy walking). Scarily enough, it is also possible to attempt to predict how users are feeling and how they may feel in the future. Using emojis through text or as reactions on social media applications can also reveal those predictions.</p>

            <h2>Targeted.</h2>
            <p>Once the predictions are in, applications begin to recognize what type of targets may grab your attention. For instance, think of asking a question about pugs then closing the search bar. Even if you have a different question afterward, some search bars may autotype in suggestions below that relate to pugs as the data has pointed to you being interested in them.</p>

            <h2>Sold.</h2>
            <p>Using these targeted predictions, Google and other companies now sell that data to advertisers. Today, most of your data is being analyzed in order to better predict products for advertisers to show to users. Afterwards, advertisers make sure to direct their content that applies to your targets. Users are now the products for advertisers to purchase in order for these companies to gain large amounts of money.</p>

        <h2>How is this legal?</h2>
        <p>Although Data Privacy Laws exist, many of them do not cover laws discussing the legality of surveillance capitalism. Despite becoming such a popular practice, the concept and process is still relatively new in regards to data laws being passed. Consequently, this practice is completely legal for companies to do, as long as they follow the existing laws. In order to change this, some organizations and groups of people have attempted to make changes to these laws.</p>

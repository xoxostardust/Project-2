            <h1>The era of surveillance capitalism.</h1>
            <p>According to the Pew Research Center, 79% of American adults are concerned about how 
                companies use the data they collect from them. Another 81% revealed they feel that 
                they have no control over how and which data is collected by companies. There is good 
                reason to, as well, considering how often surveillance capitalism is used in the online
                world. However, many are not even aware of the term that keeps their data in a chokehold online. It's time 
                for a change. A change through educating, securing, and protecting.
